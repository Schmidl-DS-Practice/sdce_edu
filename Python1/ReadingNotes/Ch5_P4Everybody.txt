Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment; subtracting 1 is called a decrement.

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:
1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False.
2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at
the next statement.
3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.

Translating this for loop to English is not as direct as the while, but if you think
of friends as a set, it goes like this: “Run the statements in the body of the for
loop once for each friend in the set named friends.”

These loops are generally constructed by:
• Initializing one or more variables before the loop starts
• Performing some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly chang-
ing the variables in the body of the loop
• Looking at the resulting variables when the loop completes

Glossary:
accumulator A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.

counter A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something happened. We initialize a counter to zero and then increment the counter each time we want to “count” something.

decrement An update that decreases the value of a variable.

initialize An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated.

increment An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one).

infinite loop A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied or for which there is no terminating condition.

iteration Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function that
calls itself or a loop.
