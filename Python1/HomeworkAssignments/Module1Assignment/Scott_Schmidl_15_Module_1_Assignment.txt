Scott Schmidl - COMP 660 - Programming with Python I - 02/01/2021 to 04/10/2021 - Section 1.5 Module 1 Assignment

1. What is a program?
	A program is a set of instructions that is passed to the Python Interpreter to be converted to machine code so 		that the machine can complete said instructions.

2. What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
	An interpreter reads the source code line-by-line, parses the code, and interprets the instructions for use by 			the machine.
	A compiler needs the entire program in a file and then translates that into machine language. The compiler 			than puts the resulting machine language into a file to be used later.
	
3. What is wrong with the following code?
	pribt()'Hello world!")
	There are a couple things wrong with the above code:
														1. pribt is a misspelling. It should be print
														2. the first ) should be deleted or the last ) deleted and 																'Hello world!" placed inside the ().
														3. use of a ' and ", to enclose "Hello world!" is invalid. 																It should be either "Hello world!" or 'Hello world!'
	The resulting corrections would give the correct answer as:
														print('Hello world!')
																or
														print("Hello world!")
														
4. What will the following program print out below the figure?
	print(y) will display the float 3.25.
	Line 2 is also in the form of y = mx+b, hence the negative sloping linear line in the graph.
