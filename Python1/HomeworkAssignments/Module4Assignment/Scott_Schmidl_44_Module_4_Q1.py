#Question 1
answer = '''A function is a named sequence of instructions, a procedure for performing some overall action.
They can take keyword arguments(a=1), regular arguments(1), and no arguments. Default arguments may also be defined
in the function definition. Functions may or may not return an expression, however returning something from a
function is not only smart, but convention(when I see functions without return statements it feels like dividing
by zero).'''
