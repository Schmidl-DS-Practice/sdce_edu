Glossary
• regression: One of several related processes for estimating parameters
that fit a model to data.
• dependent variables: The variables in a regression model we would
like to predict. Also known as endogenous variables.
• explanatory variables: The variables used to predict or explain the
dependent variables. Also known as independent, or exogenous, vari-
ables.
• simple regression: A regression with only one dependent and one
explanatory variable.
• multiple regression: A regression with multiple explanatory vari-
ables, but only one dependent variable.
• linear regression: A regression based on a linear model
• ordinary least squares: A linear regression that estimates parame-
ters by minimizing the squared error of the residuals.
• spurious relationship: A relationship between two variables that is
caused by a statistical artifact or a factor, not included in the model,
that is related to both variables.
• control variable: A variable included in a regression to eliminate or
“control for” a spurious relationship.
• proxy variable: A variable that contributes information to a regres-
sion model indirectly because of a relationship with another factor, so
it acts as a proxy for that factor.
• categorical variable: A variable that can have one of a discrete set
of unordered values.
• join: An operation that combines data from two DataFrames using a
key to match up rows in the two frames.
• data mining: An approach to finding relationships between variables
by testing a large number of models.
• logistic regression: A form of regression used when the dependent
variable is boolean.
• Poisson regression: A form of regression used when the dependent
variable is a non-negative integer, usually a count.
• odds: An alternative way of representing a probability, p, as the ratio
of the probability and its complement, p/(1 − p)
