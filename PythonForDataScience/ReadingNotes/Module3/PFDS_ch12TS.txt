Glossary
• time series: A dataset where each value is associated with a times-
tamp, often a series of measurements and the times they were collected.
• window: A sequence of consecutive values in a time series, often used
to compute a moving average.
• moving average: One of several statistics intended to estimate the
underlying trend in a time series by computing averages (of some kind)
for a series of overlapping windows.
• rolling mean: A moving average based on the mean value in each
window.
• exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA): A moving av-
erage based on a weighted mean that gives the highest weight to the
most recent values, and exponentially decreasing weights to earlier val-
ues.
• span: A parameter of EWMA that determines how quickly the weights
decrease.
• serial correlation: Correlation between a time series and a shifted or
lagged version of itself.
• lag: The size of the shift in a serial correlation or autocorrelation.
• autocorrelation: A more general term for a serial correlation with
any amount of lag.
• autocorrelation function: A function that maps from lag to serial
correlation.
• stationary: A model is stationary if the parameters and the distribu-
tion of residuals does not change over time.
