Glossary
• distribution: The values that appear in a sample and the frequency
of each.
• histogram: A mapping from values to frequencies, or a graph that
shows this mapping.
• frequency: The number of times a value appears in a sample.
• mode: The most frequent value in a sample, or one of the most frequent
values.
• normal distribution: An idealization of a bell-shaped distribution;
also known as a Gaussian distribution.
• uniform distribution: A distribution in which all values have the
same frequency.
• tail: The part of a distribution at the high and low extremes.
• central tendency: A characteristic of a sample or population; intu-
itively, it is an average or typical value.
• outlier: A value far from the central tendency.
• spread: A measure of how spread out the values in a distribution are.
• summary statistic: A statistic that quantifies some aspect of a dis-
tribution, like central tendency or spread.
• variance: A summary statistic often used to quantify spread.
• standard deviation: The square root of variance, also used as a
measure of spread.
• effect size: A summary statistic intended to quantify the size of an
effect like a difference between groups.
• clinically significant: A result, like a difference between groups, that
is relevant in practice.
