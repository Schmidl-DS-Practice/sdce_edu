Glossary
• percentile rank: The percentage of values in a distribution that are
less than or equal to a given value.
• percentile: The value associated with a given percentile rank.
• cumulative distribution function (CDF): A function that maps
from values to their cumulative probabilities. CDF(x) is the fraction
of the sample less than or equal to x.
• inverse CDF: A function that maps from a cumulative probability, p,
to the corresponding value.
• median: The 50th percentile, often used as a measure of central ten-
dency.
• interquartile range: The difference between the 75th and 25th per-
centiles, used as a measure of spread.
• quantile: A sequence of values that correspond to equally spaced per-
centile ranks; for example, the quartiles of a distribution are the 25th,
50th and 75th percentiles.
• replacement: A property of a sampling process. “With replacement”
means that the same value can be chosen more than once; “without
replacement” means that once a value is chosen, it is removed from the
population.
